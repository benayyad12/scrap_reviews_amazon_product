      "I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.\n",

      "I have two very old, inexpesive 18\" monitors that have lasted a very long time, but one of them started flaking out when hooked up to my hub.  My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office.  But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience.  Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion:  not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious.  But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable.  They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.I'm very happy with these monitors!  Easy to set up.  Great resolution and color.  SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones.  I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly.  I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings.  I'm an account/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard.  This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too.  Works great for me, but might be a consideration for others, depending on how you plan to mount them.\n",

      "A quick word of advice to everyone who buys this monitor:  when you first hook it up to your computer, you will find that the screen (esp text, when scrolling) gets quite blurry and the colors might seem blotchy.  I was thinking that the monitor was defective when I saw it, but, after some homework, figured out that the problem is caused by faulty \"overdrive\" feature (or maybe not faulty?  never actually saw this feature before).  The control for \"Overdrive\" is under \"System\" and it's set to \"medium\" by default.  Turn it off.  Then the problem of blurry screen will go away and after that, the monitor is great.  (While I can't speak to the durability of this particular product, I've had generally excellent experience with Scepter monitors, all of which (I've had 4, including this one) were very durable over 3-4 years that I've used them.  At minimum, they products are worth it, IMHO.*Original review below:The short version is that the monitor is great (it is, fwiw, the most economical FHD monitor available), but some of the features don't seem to be working quite right.  One specific problem that came out right away was that the \"Overdrive\" feature is not working properly:  when you hook it up to your computer, you will find that objects on the monitor get blurry momentarily when you scroll.  After some searching, I found out that this is due to the overdrive feature that's supposed to speed up the response time...except, in this case, it's just making objects blurrier as they move with the mouse scroll.  The overdrive is set to \"medium\" in the factory setting.  You want to turn it off as the first thing you do.  After that, you should be happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "People complain about color. Some are happy with it. Me? I wasn't ! So, I spent a good hour and a half just adjusting the colors the way I like it. Just like all my other monitors that I have. They all were bland and lacked. All OF THEM! YOU have to adjust colors. Gaming? Perfect! What?! Supersampled for better details. Not 4k? IF you could run 4k, you wouldn't be buying a cheap monitor! You need the GPU for that. I bought this for my arcade cab. Once adjusted, stunning colors! Rivals my msi. Only thing cheap is the stand. Make adjustments you'll be happy. Oh, 75 hz is fine for gaming. I have 240 on my other, not too many games like that speed, or inconsistency in fps. Up too u.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is a good monitor if you want a second monitor for your set up, is good for watching YouTube, have your discord on the side, or game on it.It arrive perfectly fine but the thing is the way they package the monitor is all good is just they need to at least put it in a blank box instead of just a monitor box…..when they delivered the monitor, they left it in front of my door facing out to the street which everyone can see what it is, I wasn’t home to take it inside but thankful my roommate call her friend to bring it in for me ._. What if someone steal the package lol, thankfully no one did. So ye just a head up if you buying this monitor make sure you/someone else ether home or put a delivery instructions where the delivery person can leave it at so no stranger can see the package ^^\n",

      "I so love this monitor and its performance that,  since 2018, I have purchased 7 of these monitors.  4 were for a home office in NJ and 2 were for a home office in FL for vacations.  I gave away the 4 in NJ, prior to moving to FL.  Thinking that I still had 4 in FL, I gave 1 of those to my brother for his security system.  Upon arrival, I realized I only originally had 2 in FL and now I was left with 1.  I struggled with 1 monitor for 4 months.  I wouldn't purchase another because the pandemic supply and demand had pushed prices too high for my retirement income and I wanted the monitors to match.  I happen to see this one at a discount which brought it into my budget range so I jumped on it.  It isn't much more than my 2018 purchases however, the last few I bought for FL all have built-in speakers and 2 HDMI ports.  Whaaaat?  So very much worth the price and I highly recommend this monitor.  The pictures are wonderful.  Can't comment on sound since I just found out that they have speakers and haven't used those yet.  I can only assume they are basic speakers for video cons.  5 stars and 2 thumbs up from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tested with the PC, works great for the price.  Sound quality isn't exactly top notch, but it's a nice bonus for the price of the monitor, and I'm glad its included.  Good viewing angle for the price.  1080p is fine for my needs honestly.I mainly bought this for a MAME cabinet.  Using the VGA port, and everything in the menu is customizable, autodetects perfectly, and all that.If you need a simple monitor that works great for the price, but is cheap where you wont care too much if your kids or pet damages it, this works great.So far, very happy with the purchase.Only complaint is I wish the 100mm VESA mount on the back was more center to the monitor, and the metal part where the desk stand sticks out a little, making it where the screws for the 100mm VESA mount need extenders for the screws (included).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered this monitor to be used as a second screen for my work from home set up. It is vet straight forward and simple to operate. It comes with an HDMI cable so I had to buy an additional adapter for my laptop. There’s no lag and greasy picture quality. It is possible to Mount it to the wall, but I used the stand. It is possible to slightly tilt the screen up or down to adjust to your viewing height. I have not used it for gaming or video so I can’t speak to that quality. If you are looking for a great second (or third) monitor for your home office this is the one. Highly recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Haven't tested the display quality itself. However, upon assembling the monitor to the neck and base, I'm finding that it tilts slightly forward (pointing the display at a downward angle). Tried taking the neck off again to see if I could adjust the angle, since the product description says it should be able to tilt in a range of +5 to -15 degrees. Could not manage to make the monitor tilt backward.Even with all the other features—hdmi and VGA ports, audio features, etc—if I can't adjust the angle for basic ergonomic purposes, this can't be my monitor. Likely going to return, unless the seller can manage to resolve this issue.EDIT: So I tried to change the tilt again, this time using the neck to \"wrench\" the metal joint. It made me nervous the whole time, since it felt like I was potentially applying excessive force and about to make something snap. But the angle did change. Revised my initial review while I wait to test other features.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered this monitor because my old 30in cheapo tv finally took a crap, so I bought this and made it my main display making my LG Flatron W2246 my secondary display. It's not a terrible monitor for what you paid for. In some ways it's better than the LG in some ways, brighter whites and slightly more saturated darks. One issue I have with it is that I can't get the 75Hz refresh rate that is on the box and in the manual. Another issue I have is that it's not as crisp as the LG, when watching videos the image is slightly more crisp and cooler as far as color. Overall this monitor is a great beginner monitor if you buy it at the $90 that I did, just make sure that if you are running a dual monitor setup that you have a stand that let's you adjust the height of the monitors individually because the VESA mount is low on the monitor and that most likely will put it at a higher viewing angle than your other monitor... trust me I know.\n",
